Welcome to the TTCore ReadMe. This should be read if you plan to use TTCore to assit your Plugin or attempting to modify
the current code.

Modify:
	If you want to modify any code within the TTCore, please make a new branch with the changes you want to make, after that
	submit your pull request and let one of the GitHub Owners read it. This allows the changeLog to be maintained and also
	improves your code, not only that but removes repeating code. 
	
	All methods and classes that are used for the API must be documented on what they do with /** */ this allows eclipse to
	read the text between and display it for when someone hovers over the method/class name.
	
	All API's must have a .txt file that explain what the API does and how to use it.
	
Working with:
	When working with the TTCore plugin, you need to know how to use the API's it contains. When you go into the SRC of the
	TTCore, you will be greeted with all the API's TTCore has. When you enter one of them, you will find a .txt file 
	explaining how to use it. Not only that, but Eclipse will state what each and every method does if you hover over it
	(other IDE's may not do this)
