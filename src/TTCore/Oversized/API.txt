How to use the Oversized API.

The oversized API is used to put as much text as you like on a field that is limited, such as a sign line, or scoreboard 
objective. There are a few already programmed into the Oversized API and here are all the oversized Core will have

	As of 1.10.2
	- Signs
	- Scoreboard - objectives
	

Creating your own oversized:
	after creating a new class, you need to extends OversizedTicker. This will give you a method that is simply called tick,
	and is called every time the text should be updated and moved. You will also have a contructer with the requirements of
	limit. this is simply the amount of letters you wish to present.
	
	<Code>:
		public class Blar extends OversizedTicker{
		
			public Blar(int limit){
				super(limit);
			}
		
			public void tick(){
			}
		}
	</code>
	
	after that you can use the following method to get the next bit of text. The full message is the whole message
	
	<Code>:
		String fullMessage;
		String displayNowMessage = getNext(fullMessage);
	</code>
	
Working with OverrizedSign:

	working with the oversized sign is easy as long as you get your head around it.
	
	first of all you will need to create a list of ThreeStore<Integer, Boolean, ChatColor>. The first is the line number,
	the second is if that linenumber should be oversized, that chatColor is the color of the sign (can be null). and then
	use the contructor
	
	<code>:
		Block sign;
		List<OversizedSignLine> actLine = new ArrayList<>();
		actLine.add(new OversizedSignLine("This message is over 16 letters", 1)); //line 2 will now be oversized with no chatColor
		actLine.add(new OversizedSignLine("Another oversized line", 3, ChatColor.YELLOW); //line 4 will now be oversized with chatColor yellow
		OversizedSign osSign = new OversizedSign(sign, actLine);
	</code>
	
	after that it will automaticly start to display the whole line on the sign
	
force moving the text:
	this works with all Oversized objects. if you have a oversized object then you can force it to display the next part.
	<code>
		OversizedTicker ticker;
		ticker.tick();
	</code>
