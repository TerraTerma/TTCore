How to use the Saver API.

The saver API is a simple API that extends from YamlConfiguration. The SaverAPI is a lot like the normal YamlConiguration
but instead of needing to remember all the methods (getBoolean, getInteger, getString) you just need to remember one, not
only that but because it has the File and the YamlConfiguration in the same class, it means it is easy to transfer the
Saver around API's. The MechAPI (save part of it) relies heavily on the Saver API because of its ease to transfer.

You can also extend from the Saver class, allowing you to save select things and direct things. such as the EventSaver from
ModLog that saves the basic data of a event and then uses abstract to gain the rest of the data

creating a Saver
	this is very simple
	<Code>:
		Saver saver = new Saver(File file);
	</code>

getting data
	again simple. You can add as many Strings onto the end as you like, the divides represent a . in the YamlConfiguration
	<Code>:
		Saver saver;
		String data = saver.get(String.class, "loc", "at", "tion");
		ItemStack item = saver.get(ItemStack.class, "path");
		int something = saver.get(Integer.class, "path", "amount");
	</code>
	
setting data
	again simple. again works like the getter with the path
	
	<Code>:
		Saver saver;
		saver.set(thing, "path", "to", "it");
		saver.set(anotherThing, "path", "to", "the", "other");
		saver.save();
	</code>
Getting all possible values:
	If you need to get all possible values and keys to go with that, now you can. You can get all keys and values of the
	target or you can get the nested keys as values as well as the target ones.
	
	<Code>:
		Saver saver;
		Map<String, Object> values = saver.values(false);
	</code>
	
	the String part of the map will be the key (as in the path) and the Object will be the value that was there (you will
	need to upcast it). the boolean on the values method is a check for if you want the nested values too.
SpecialSaver use:
	SpecialSaver is a very usful tool that saves and gets special objects that are not normally supported with Saver (saver
	supports all object types that YamlConfig does). There are some object types that are in the SpecialSaver to remove
	confusion. 
	
	<Code>:
		Saver saver;
		Optional<ItemStack> opItem = new SpecialSaver().getItemStack(saver, "Path", "To", "It");
	</code>
	

I dont know what to put in this because it is extreemly simple as long as you understand basic java.
